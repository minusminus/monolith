# Commutator by Monolith

This 4kb was to be released at Astrosyn 2000, but we've failed to crunch the size on time, and so it was released after the party.

All the work was done using watcom 10.5, tasm/tlink, apack, eoslite.
Nowdays nobody knows how to compile it, but original compiled and working version is in _Release_ directory.
